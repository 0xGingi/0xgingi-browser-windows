Go to: %localappdata%\Chromium\Application\YOUR_CHROMIUM_VERSION

Create a new folder named WidevineCdm - Extract LICENSE.txt and manifest.json

Inside WidevineCdm folder, create another folder _platform_specific

Inside _platform_specific folder, create another folder named win_x64 - Extract widevinecdm.dll, widevinecdm.dll.lib, and widevinecdm.dll.sig inside the win_x64 folder

Close 0xGingi-Browser & Reopen it, WideVine should now be enabled, you can confirm under chrome://components/

Create a backup of the WidevineCdm Folder to easily readd Widevine after an update!

- Modify some internal chromium components with better alternatives (e.g. Bromite Patches)
- Remove google telemetry/spyware

## TO-DO

- More Hardening
- Other Misc. Changes to Enchance Privacy

## Building

### Setting up the build environment

#### Setting up Visual Studio

[Follow the "Visual Studio" section of the official Windows build instructions](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/windows_build_instructions.md#visual-studio).

* Make sure to read through the entire section and install/configure all the required components.
* If your Visual Studio is installed in a directory other than the default, you'll need to set a few environment variables to point the toolchains to your installation path. (Copied from [instructions for Electron](https://electronjs.org/docs/development/build-instructions-windows))
	* `vs2022_install = DRIVE:\path\to\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community` (replace `2022` and `Community` with your installed versions)
	* `WINDOWSSDKDIR = DRIVE:\path\to\Windows Kits\10`
	* `GYP_MSVS_VERSION = 2022` (replace 2022 with your installed version's year)


#### Other build requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Currently, the `MAX_PATH` path length restriction (which is 260 characters by default) must be lifted in for our Python build scripts. This can be lifted in Windows 10 (v1607 or newer) with the official installer for Python 3.6 or newer (you will see a button at the end of installation to do this). See [Issue #345](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium/issues/345) for other methods for other Windows versions.

1. Setup the following:

    * 7-zip
    * Python 3.6 - 3.9 or 3.10.2+ (for build and packaging scripts used below)
        * At the end of the Python installer, click the button to lift the `MAX_PATH` length restriction.
        * Check that your `PATH` does not contain the `python3` wrapper shipped by Windows, as it will only promt you to install Python from the Microsoft Store and exit. See [this question on stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57485491/python-python3-executes-in-command-prompt-but-does-not-run-correctly)
    * Git
        * During setup, make sure "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" is selected. This is usually the recommended option.

### Building

NOTE: The commands below assume the `py` command was installed by Python 3 into `PATH`. If this is not the case, then substitute it with `python3`.

Run in `cmd.exe` (as administrator):

```cmd
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/0xGingi/0xgingi-browser
pip3 install pillow
py build.py
cp -r modified-files/* /
cd rebrand
(modify script.py with the location of 0xGingi-Browser source)
py config.py
py script.py
cd ..
py build2.py
py package.py
```

A zip archive and an installer will be created under `build`.

**NOTE**: If the build fails, you must take additional steps before re-running the build:

* If the build fails while downloading the Chromium source code (which is during `build.py`), it can be fixed by removing `build\download_cache` and re-running the build instructions.
* If the build fails at any other point during `build.py`, it can be fixed by removing everything under `build` other than `build\download_cache` and re-running the build instructions. This will clear out all the code used by the build, and any files generated by the build.

An efficient way to delete large amounts of files is using `Remove-Item PATH -Recurse -Force`. Be careful however, files deleted by that command will be permanently lost.
